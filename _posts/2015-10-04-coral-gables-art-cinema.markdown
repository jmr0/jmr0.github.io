description: 'I redesigned <a href="http://www.gablescinema.com" target="_blank">gablescinema.com</a> with a clean, responsive layout that brings their content to the forefront on both desktop and mobile platforms. I delivered a customized Django CMS that reduced the time to create film entries from 30 minutes to 3 minutes. I also made it very easy to integrate with their 3<sup>rd</sup> party payment API. Content is aggressively cached to ensure <em>quick</em> server responses. I wore every hat for this project -- design, front-end and back-end development, and system administrator tasks such as deployment and switching DNS records to a new host.'
