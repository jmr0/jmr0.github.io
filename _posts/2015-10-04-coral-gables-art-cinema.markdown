description: 'I redesigned <a href="http://www.gablescinema.com" target="_blank">gablescinema.com</a> with a clean, responsive layout that brings their content to the forefront on both desktop and mobile platforms. I delivered a customized deployment of django CMS to offer a quick way of managing their content (in fact, it used to take 30 minutes for them to create a film entry -- it now takes 3) and an easy way to integrate with their 3<sup>rd</sup> party payment API. Content is aggressively cached to ensure quick server responses. I wore every hat for this project -- design, front-end and back-end development, as well as system administrator tasks such as deployment and switching DNS records to a new host.'
